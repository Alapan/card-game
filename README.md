## About
A card game built with React, Typescript and Vite.

### Card game rules

A total of 12 cards are present, all face down. A player flips 2 cards in every move. If the cards are the same, the player gets a point. If not, the cards go back to their original state of being face down. The player has to flip all the cards using the minimum number of moves compared to other players on the leaderboard to gain rankings.
